# Digital Health Solutions

This was a  a group project where I built a simple web application which displays information to help people suffering from diabetes and highblood pressure. It also displayed health tips (FAQs) for easy access to answers of frequently asked questions related to the above mentioned health health conditions. Lastly, we implemented an offline chatbot system which served to assist site visitors navigate the page efficiently.
